# 🏆 Code Wars Coding Challenges

### Welcome to the Chamber of Blood Sweat and Tears 
This repository is where I store all the solutions I've created to solve coding challenges across the internet. 

#### What is a Coding Challenge? 🧩
A coding challenge is a computer based test that assess your ability to use math and logic to solve a problem. There are many webstites the host these challenges online for you to complete at leisure. I'm currently using [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

#### Why do them? 🤔 
I love improving as an engineer. I work really hard to not only understand these problems, but also solve them in the most effienct way possible. This sort of deliberate practice is what sharpens your computational logic skills. At the end of the day, my competency as an engineer isn't going to improve on it's own, so I work at it by doing these challenges. Plus... who doesn't love a good puzzle? 😌 😄

#### What is Codewars?
Codewars is a ninja themed coding challenge platform where you have the oppurtunity to  level up as you solve problems. Both the challenges and users are ranked on a scale of 8kyu to 1kyu, with 8kyu being the easiest/beginner and 1kyu being the hardest/grandmaster.

<h2 id="notes">📓 Repo Organization & Notes</h2>
I've grouped my solutions based on platform and difficulty level. Each solution is in a file labeled by the problem name, so if you want to do the same one, you'll be able to find it by seacrching the file name on the platform.  
<br><br>
JavaScript is usually my language of choice, so you'll find most of my solutions are written in that language.<br><br>

Not every solution I've completed is in this repository,  just ones I feel are worth saving. Checkout my profile on each platform for all the other ones Ive done!

#### Thanks for stopping by! 😊
